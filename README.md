- **Responsiveness**:  
  The site layout adapts across screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system and media queries. Tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **Accessibility**:  
  - Semantic HTML used throughout (e.g., `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).  
  - Good contrast between text and background.  
  - Interactive elements are reachable via keyboard and clearly styled on focus.  
  - Minimal use of images, but icons are decorative and non-intrusive.

## ✍️ Reflections on Development

### AI Tools in Development

AI tools were used as a supplement during development—not to do the work, but to speed up parts of the process. They helped:

- Suggest layout ideas using Bootstrap (e.g., accordion structure and card styling).
- Identify small HTML structure issues and Bootstrap class mistakes during debugging.
- Recommend colour pairings for accessibility and contrast.
- Offer wording suggestions for affirmation text and user-facing messages.

These tools supported productivity but all code was reviewed and edited to ensure clarity, relevance, and alignment with the project’s goals.
